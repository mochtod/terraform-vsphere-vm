# Progress Status

## What Works
- Basic web interface for VM provisioning
- Workspace management (creation, selection, deletion)
- Terraform integration for plan and apply operations
- Global settings management
- VM specification forms
- Terraform variable generation
- Deployment history tracking
- Theme toggle (light/dark mode)
- VM status monitoring
- Infrastructure dropdown population from vSphere API using govc
- Password field handling in the UI with enhanced detection
- Fallback to sample data when API calls fail
- VM templates retrieval via enhanced API

## What's Left to Build/Fix
- Workspace 404 error handling
- The workspace should start blank, and load the last existing configuration or lack of configuration for that workspace
- Further connection validation for external systems
- VM customization after deployment
- Enhanced error handling for edge cases
- Complete integration with Ansible Automation Platform
- Testing with actual vSphere environment
