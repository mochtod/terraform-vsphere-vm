# Progress

## What Works
- VM provisioning through vSphere
- Basic network configuration and customization
- VM template selection and cloning
- Terraform state management
- CHR API integration (fixed API endpoint URLs)

## What's Left to Build
- Improve error handling for API connectivity issues
- Add more robust retry logic for network failures
- Create automated testing for the registration process
- Implement monitoring for registration success rates

## Progress Status
- CHR API endpoint issue fixed: The VM provisioning was failing at the CHR registration step due to 404 errors. The API URL has been corrected by:
  - Using the base URL in the variables.tf file without duplicating path components
  - Fixing API path duplication by removing redundant "/api/v2/" prefixes in API calls
  - Ensuring all status and error messages reference the correct endpoints
  - Fixing template syntax issues with curl commands
  - Adding enhanced connectivity diagnostics with HTTP tests and traceroute

This should resolve the "The page you were looking for doesn't exist (404)" errors from the CHR API. The VM provisioning should now complete successfully with proper CHR Satellite registration.
