# Active Context

## Current Task
Fixing CHR API endpoint issues in the terraform-vsphere-vm-3 project. The CHR API was returning 404 errors because the endpoint URL was incorrectly configured.

## Recent Changes
- Updated the CHR API endpoint in `modules/vm/variables.tf` to use the base URL (https://satellite.chrobinson.com) without the API path suffix
- Fixed API path duplication issues in `modules/vm/main.tf` by ensuring paths are consistently referenced
- Removed redundant "/api/v2/" prefixes in API calls to prevent double path issues
- Fixed Terraform template syntax issues by properly escaping the curl %{http_code} parameter
- Enhanced connectivity testing with HTTP connectivity checks and diagnostics
- Added traceroute for network path diagnostics when connectivity issues are detected
- Confirmed proper handling of host_group parameter from tfvars files to the registration API

## Next Steps
- Verify the CHR registration works correctly in a test deployment
- Consider adding more robust error handling for API connectivity issues
- Add additional logging to track registration success rates
